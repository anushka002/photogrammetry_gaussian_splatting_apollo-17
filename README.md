# Photogrammetry and Gaussian Splatting on Apollo 17 Imagery

This repository presents a photogrammetric reconstruction of Apollo 17 imagery, followed by Gaussian Splatting-based view synthesis and model augmentation. The objective is to evaluate whether novel views generated via splatting can enhance photogrammetric mesh quality when used alongside original imagery.

## Overview

This assignment is divided into two parts:

- **Part A**: Reconstruct a textured 3D mesh model using Agisoft Metashape with 15 Apollo 17 images. Evaluate how well the model captures spatial and texture accuracy.
- **Part B**: Apply Gaussian Splatting to generate novel views. Rebuild a photogrammetry model using the original and synthesized images (N=25). Compare the results qualitatively and quantitatively.
